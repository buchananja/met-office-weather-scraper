# Met Office Weather Station Data Scraping
This is a Python-based web scraper that extracts historical weather station data from the [Met Office website](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/historic-station-data).

The aim of this project is to automate the collection, processing, formatting, and plotting of data across the UK's 37 historic weather stations to build a picture of how the UK's weather has changed over time and how it varies across the island.
